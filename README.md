# AOM Vanilla OBS Maps

This repository contains the original random map scripts from Age Of Mythology. The maps have been altered to support a basic form of 'observer players' since the original unmodified game did not support any form of observing a game. The maps however, have not been altered in what they generate and stay 100% faithful to the olden days of AOM vanilla (besides the balance patches over the years if there were any).

This map pack was specially made for a tournament held back in 2017 (more info [here](https://www.rts-sanctuary.com/The-Titans/showtopic=243204)) with actual money prizes. (1st $200, 2nd $100, 3rd $50, etc).

It would be main for me not to give credit to RebelsRising for creating the original OBS_Lib.xs for Age Of Mythology Titans, part of a Voobly mod. This map pack contains a modified version of it since AOM Vanilla didn't like the trigger injection code.
